# go-htmx-forge

A blazing-fast Go template combining Chi and templ for building modern hypermedia-driven web applications with minimal JavaScript and maximum efficiency.

## Features

- **Chi** - High performance, minimalist web framework
- **Templ** - Type-safe HTML templates for Go
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **OpenBSD Ready** - Configured for OpenBSD deployment
- **Redis Support** - Prepared for Redis integration
- **PostgreSQL Support** - Prepared for PostgreSQL integration
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated PR and Production workflows

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/jrswab/go-htmx-forge your-project-name

# Navigate to project
cd your-project-name

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest

# Start development server
make run
```

To run Tailwind use Tailwind's [Standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli). This forge does not use the npm/npx version when running locally.

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your application running.
